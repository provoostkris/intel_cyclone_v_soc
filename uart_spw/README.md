### UART SPW
The design is a bridge between a regular UART and SpW node.
For now the top level file internally loops the spw tx and rx, so the uart interface part can be tested

### Example output

We send 'hello world.' 4 times in the terminal with CR or LF and immediatly print what is recieved
```
hello world.hhell  wrrldhello world.heeloo wrrlâ€”hello world.helll wwrlldhello world.heell wooldd
```
It is obvious that there is something wrong in the design as the data coming back is different from the data transmitted.
